# TerraXY
TerraXY is an opensource, small footprint, fast 3d printer designed and built by deBlauwe and I.

inspired by panda-mini, SnakeOilXY, ratrig and Voron. Thank you for opensourcing your work!
The goal was to maintain the 230x230mm build area of an ender-3 but to make it faster, more reliable and to keep it compact.

# Goals
The cornerstones of the design are:
- Use off the shelf or 3d printed parts
- Stay under €400 when upgrading an ender 3 for parts or 500 when building from scratch
- Use ender-3 parts to keep the cost down
- Run klipper and an web interface
- Keep the gantry weight down.

Special thanks to Chip for answering some of my questions, I really appreciate it!
